# quantum-random-aes
CNIT 370 project for utilizing quantum randomness in a cipher block chaining implementation of AES

AES Python
1. Command for accepting a message as arg, prints the cipher text (encrypt)ðŸ”’
2. Command for accepting ciphertext as arg,  prints message (decrypt)ðŸ”‘
3. Arbitrary IV input and processing (weird and undocumented for Crypto library)

AWS:
1. Quantum circuit: simulated and non-simulated runs

Middleware:
1. AWS CLI called from Python code? Would run circuit via Lambda function
2. Include toggle flag in code, default simulated
